# NutritionAgent
This project aims to develop “The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant” using generative AI models. By integrating health data, food databases, and LLM-powered reasoning, this solution will bridge the gap between one-size-fits-all diet apps &amp; in-person nutrition counselling—delivering an AI that thinks, learns, &amp; cares like a real nutrition expert.
